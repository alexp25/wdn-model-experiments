Advantages of Decision Trees
There are several advantages of using decision treess for predictive analysis:

Decision trees can be used to predict both continuous and discrete values i.e. they work well for both regression and classification tasks.
They require relatively less effort for training the algorithm.
They can be used to classify non-linearly separable data.
They're very fast and efficient compared to KNN and other classification algorithms.
